                <h2>The Intro</h2>
                <p>HackDecatur is all about helping the City of Decatur through software. For one weekend, we'll all
                come together to write code that benefits the entire city of Decatur, not just one business or cause.
                </p>
                <h2>The Issue</h2>
<<<<<<< HEAD
                <p>Decatur has a thriving business scene, with new restaurants, stores, and venues opening every other week. All of 
                    these businesses have problems they need solved. That's where you come in.
                </p>
                <h2>The Problem &amp; The Solution</h2>
                <p>Outside of the technology industry, code literacy is scarce in many 
                businesses. Due to the fact that software is used less commonly to solve problems, owners of large and small 
                businesses alike face trivial issues that could be solved by simple web apps, mobile interfaces, or even just simple databases.
                </p>
                <p>
                At HackDecatur, we want to draw together talented technologists, designers, business owners, and idea people to
                tackle the task of making Decatur's organizations more efficient. Local businesses around the area that have chosen to participate in HackDecatur have presented problems for the attendees to solve using code. For each problem solved, a local business becomes more technologically oriented, and an attendee claims a bounty put forth by said local business. It's a win-win.

                <h2>The Solution</h2>
                <p>In the modern age, software can solve just about any problem that can be solved. Unfortunately, the true power
                of code isn't realized by very many people. Outside of the technology industry, code literacy is scarce in many 
                businesses. Due to the fact that software is used less commonly to solve problems, owners of large and small 
                businesses alike face trivial issues that could be solved by simple web apps, mobile interfaces, or even simple databases
                in the cloud.
